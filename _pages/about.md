I am a PhD student in Computer Science at the University of Chicago, working at the [Robot Intelligence through Perception Laboratory (RIPL)](https://ttic.edu/ripl/) at the Toyota Technological Institute at Chicago (TTIC), where I am advised by [Dr. Matthew Walter](https://home.ttic.edu/~mwalter/). My research focuses on unsupervised representation learning for robotics and reinforcement learning from in-the-wild human videos, with the overarching goal of enabling generalizable robot learning across diverse and unstructured environments. I care deeply about developing learning methods that scale beyond curated datasets and lab settings, and that can transfer across tasks and embodiments. In line with LeCun's "AI cake" metaphor, my work sits primarily in the "cake" itself—self-supervised learning—and in the "cherry" on top, reinforcement learning. By grounding both components in real-world visual data, I aim to build systems that can learn from passive observation and adapt actively, bridging the gap between passive video understanding and embodied robotic action. Before starting my PhD, I completed an M.Sc. in Computer Science at the University of Saskatchewan, working with [Dr. Ian Stavness](https://www.cs.usask.ca/faculty/stavness/) on unsupervised computer vision. I hold a B.Sc. in Software Engineering from Addis Ababa University.
