I am a PhD student in Computer Science at the University of Chicago, working at the [Robot Intelligence through Perception Laboratory (RIPL)](https://ttic.edu/ripl/) at the Toyota Technological Institute at Chicago (TTIC), where I am advised by [Dr. Matthew Walter](https://home.ttic.edu/~mwalter/). My research focuses on self-supervised representation learning for robotics and reinforcement learning from human data. Before starting my PhD, I completed an M.Sc. in Computer Science at the University of Saskatchewan, working with [Dr. Ian Stavness](https://www.cs.usask.ca/faculty/stavness/) on unsupervised computer vision. I hold a B.Sc. in Software Engineering from Addis Ababa University.
